This is a short project demonstrating my capability of building a login/signup system with all modern-day features like forgot password and email verification. It is just a simple feature that most websites use to allow users to log in and create an account.

Technologies Used in this Project:
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Nodemailer
* Various NPM Modules

What I learned Building this project:
* Learned how to properly connect and save data in MongoDB Cloud.
* Learned about node-mailer.
* Got to know what is SMTP and how to send Emails via programs.

Thank You...
